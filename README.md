# Nine Two

Nine Two is a website that allows the user to access data on the 92 football clubs in the top 4 flights of English football. While some of the data from 
thesportsdb.com API is slightly outdated, the app was still a useful exercise into exploring the world of APIs themselves, and presenting data to a user in a 
responsive, understandable fashion.
